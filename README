Magic 8-ball Quest

The Magic 8-ball Quest is an application that answers any yes or no questions fed to it in classic 8-ball fashion.
Except sometimes the 8-ball sends the user into a short quest to retrieve it.
The quest taken by the user is determined by a randomly chosen character from their question, this allows their question to have an agency into determining their fate.

This program is writte in C language, to run it, first compile it using gcc 8-Ball_Quest.c and then run it using ./a.out
